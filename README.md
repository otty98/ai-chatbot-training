# AI Educational Chatbot

This repository contains the training data and deployment instructions for the AI Educational Chatbot. This chatbot aims to educate users about foundational AI concepts, including machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), neural networks, computer vision, and AI ethics.

## Project Overview

The AI Educational Chatbot serves as a knowledge assistant for anyone looking to understand the basics of artificial intelligence. It was developed using Botpress, a no-code platform for creating conversational agents, and is intended to support students, developers, and AI enthusiasts in learning core AI concepts.

## Features

* Handles at least 15 Q/A pairs covering key AI topics.
* Supports multiple follow-up questions for each main topic.
* Includes multimedia elements for richer learning experiences.
* Provides a 'further learning' feature to guide users to recommended courses.
* Enforces strict topic boundaries to ensure responses are focused on AI.

## Training Topics

The chatbot is trained on the following core AI topics:

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Overview
2. Machine Learning (ML)
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
4. Large Language Models (LLMs)
5. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
6. AI Ethics and Real-world Applications

## Further Learning Feature

To guide users to deeper knowledge on AI concepts, the chatbot includes the following further learning resources:

* **For AI Fundamentals:** [AI For Everyone (deeplearning.ai)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone)
* **For Machine Learning:** [Introduction to AI (IBM)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone)
* **For Generative AI and LLMs:** [Introduction to Generative AI (Google Cloud)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai)
* **For Advanced AI Concepts:** [AI Essentials (Intel)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-essentials)
